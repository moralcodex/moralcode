### Moral Precept
Refrain from actions that cause harm to others or yourself.

### Rationale
This precept acknowledges that harm, in any form, disrupts well-being and relationships. Rooted in the principles of empathy and respect, it encourages individuals to consider the impact of their actions on others. Found in traditions like the Hippocratic Oath ("First, do no harm") and Ahimsa in Indian philosophy, this principle guides ethical behavior by prioritizing the minimization of suffering and the promotion of harmony.
