### Moral Precept
Embrace accountability

### Rationale
This precept establishes a foundational principle that makes explicit the idea that we have at least some element of control and can & should be held accountable for our decisions, actions and the consequences associated. It is almost an underlying principle to other precepts, e.g. do no harm, in that it ascribes agency to the individual to be aware that they have the accountability to do so.
