### Moral Precept
Tell the truth, the whole truth & nothing but the truth.

### Rationale
When you lie, you are lying to yourself. When you tell the truth, you are telling the truth to yourself. Lies and desinformation create friction in the system of human society and emotional damage in to other human beings. This can have negative consequences on the other moral precepts. Sticking to the truth also adds another incentive to follow the other moral precepts to avoid shame and dishonour.
