Description: There is a different standard of justice applied for those in power, versus the common man. Everyone deserves to be treated fairly and equally.
---

### Moral Precept
Treat everyone equally regardless of differences in economic wealth or influence. Might does not equal right.

### Rationale
Inequality and double standards for the powerful, ensures their rights are overrepresented and overrule those of anyone else. Over time, the downtrodden and economically disadvantaged will resort to nihilism or even outright revolution. 
At best we will live in a world of envy and despair, at worst in a wasteland of lawless violence.
