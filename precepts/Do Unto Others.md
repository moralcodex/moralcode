###Moral Precept
"Treat others as you would wish to be treated."

###Rationale
This precept establishes a foundational principle of reciprocity that fosters mutual respect and harmony within communities. By aligning one's behavior with the expectations they have of others, it promotes empathy, fairness, and ethical consistency. It is rooted in the idea that our actions create a ripple effect, shaping the broader social environment in which we all coexist.
