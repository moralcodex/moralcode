This is a directory for software that might be built in support of the project.

Wish list includes:

- automating link between github and the DAO for proposals
- automating link back from DAO to github with DAO decisions
- allocating community tokens to contributors who successfully amend the main branch
- being able to airdrop community tokens to contributors to the github

.... and much more!
