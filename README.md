# moralcode
This is the home of the open source moral code project.

Many people find themselves in the vast space between religious belief on one end of the spectrum, or nihilism on the other.
In between there are people who believe that the universe has a built-in moral structure.
There are others who think that morality is a merely human construct, or a necessity for any animal with a complex social structure.
Even militant atheists need to ask themselves what rules they need to live by if they are not derived from religous teachings.
For those of us in the middle, we need a moral code.

Assume this code is something constructed by humans.  What better way to construct it than as an open source project.
In 'The Cathedral and the Bazaar' it says that open source projects work when the contributors are motivated to use the code.  

This should apply to a moral code as much as it applies to Linux.

This repository welcomes contributions from anyone.  Please use the pro forma for all submissions!
Initially the sacred timeline will be centrally controlled, but only until there is a good draft moral codebase.
At that point commits will be decentralised to a DAO running on Solana.

Here is the Moral Code DAO: https://app.realms.today/dao/6LiFxYtQuoNvjLrYPWc53aSx5hVk7kakm8vyh74mHnUM

Initially DAO proposals and decisions will be through a council, but this will soon be passed over to the holders of governance tokens.
