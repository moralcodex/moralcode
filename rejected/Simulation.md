### Rejected Moral Precept

The chances are that we live inside a computer simulation and therefore nothing is 'real'.  Other people are Non Player Characters (NPCs) and your job is to win the game.  There is no moral structure, just a pattern of programmed rewards and punishments.

### Rationale for Rejection

Questioning the nature of reality is good, but conducting oneself as if one is a player in a computer game is not.  One who seriously thinks that this is a simulation is unable to respect others as sentient moral beings as they doubt their own reality.  Subsribers to the simulation theory should recuse themselves from wielding influence over others and might consider going 'Howard Hughes' until they have sorted out their heads and hearts.
