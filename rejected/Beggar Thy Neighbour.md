### Rejected Moral Precept

Beggar thy neighbour.  It is valid for me to pursue my interests at the expense of yours.

### Rationale for Rejection

The short-sighted policy of beggar thy neighbour has been rejected time and again as an unwise course of action.  While it is possible to obtain short term gain through imposing costs on others, every such action has negative consequences that rebound on the opportunist who seeks momentary advantage.  Beggar thy neighbour policies instill revulsion in their victims, who often live to enjoy the exploiter's downfall.
